# **Melting Gerry**

## **Flow Chart**
The Lucid application was used to create a flow chart for the Melting Gerry game. The flowchart shown below helped me to identify all essential steps within the game and simultaneously offer the bigger picture of the project.

Creating a flowchart helped me find less obvious features of the program's algorithm, which were then refined to improve its performance, ie bottlenecks, flaws, and unnecessary steps.

## **User Experience (UX)**

### **User Goals**
* The game is easy to navigate and provides appropriate functionality to entertain the user.
* The game should have different categories of words the user can choose from.
* Each category should contain words of varying difficulty to guess.
* There should be a decent number of words for each category.
* The game rules should be clearly explained.
* The game should allow the user to continue to play after each game.
* The user should know how many attempts are left to guess the word.
* The user should know which letters have already been used.
* The game should appropriately handle the user entries.
